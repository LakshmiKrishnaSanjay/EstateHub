    { question: 'How do I contact a property owner?', answer: 'You can contact the owner via the built-in chat feature or call them if their contact number is provided in the listing.' },
    { question: 'How do I buy or rent a property?', answer: 'Once you find a suitable property, contact the owner or agent directly to negotiate terms and complete the transaction offline.' },
    { question: 'How do I add a review?', answer: 'Go to the property page, scroll to the reviews section, and click "Add Review" to share your experience.' },
    { question: 'How do I check a property location?', answer: 'Each listing includes a map feature that shows the property location. You can also use the given address for navigation.' },
    { question: 'How do I make a payment?', answer: 'Payments are handled directly between buyers and sellers. We do not process transactions on the platform, so users must ensure safety before making any payments.' },
    { question: 'Is there any risk in payments?', answer: 'Since transactions are done outside the platform, the risk is in the hands of the users. Always verify the seller before making any payments.' },
